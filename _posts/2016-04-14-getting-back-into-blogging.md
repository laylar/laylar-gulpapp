<p>Blogging. It's not entirely new, I've blogged about lots of things.</p>
<p>Even coding.</p>
<p>This time there's a bit more <i>code</i> involved in the code blog itself.</p>
<p>It's definitely going to be more customized.</p>
<p>
This portfolio course, taught by <a href="http://ric.mclaughlin.today/">
Ric McLaughlin</a>, has filled in so many blanks in my github, bash, and rvm 
knowledge, and gotten me started on Jekyll and Cloud 9, so far.
</p>
<h5>Here are some of the tidbits that I want to remember:</h5>
<ul>
    <li>"git add ." I usually use "git add -A", which prompted a quest to 
    figure out the difference. And I found "git add -u", too...</li>
    <li>To start the server from C9: jekyll serve --host $IP --port $PORT --baseurl '' </li>
    <li>To add a new post: rake post title=""</li>
    <li>My github profile page was here: <a href="laylar.github.io">laylar.github.io</a>, 
    but now it's here: <a href="www.layla.tech">layla.tech</a>!</li>
</ul>

<p>I can't wait for my next class tomorrow!</p>
